### Reflections on the Course

**How did it feel? Are there any parts that were confusing or that you particularly struggled with? Are there any areas that moved too slowly or quickly for you? What is your plan of attack moving forward to overcome these obstacles?**

Wow. Learning new coding languages is always a complete whirlwind for the first few weeks—but I’ve been loving it. It feels so refreshing to work with advanced styling and interactive design. It’s crazy to think that I have only done HTML and CSS so far. Even though I only learned those two starting five months ago, it feels like it’s been a couple years! And I hope I still am doing this in a couple years. 

At current, I’m most struggling with figuring out the relationship between p5.js and Javascript and HTML and other applications like AngularJS. But this is very similar to the initial confusion I had last semester with the difference between HTML, CSS, C++, Atom text editor, and FileZilla. Ha! They seem so extremely different now, and I suppose soon enough I will understand the differences between the former. More specifically to p5.js, I am trying to figure out how to use conditionals and how to apply specific applications to specified conditionals. 

I think this class is moving at a perfect speed, and I love that so much of it is Matt allowing us to just hack out code on our own. I really appreciate the “try and fail then try again” aspect of the course… it allows (forces?) me to do the research and really learn the code for myself, as opposed to being spoon-fed instruction. 

As far as a plan of attack, I’m going to just keep on doing what I’m doing. I enjoy this type of work so much that it really isn’t work. If I get stuck I go to Google and/or StackOverflow. If I don’t find the answer there, I keep playing around with the code. If I still don’t figure it out, I’ll email Matt or stop in office hours. Or ask my coder-friend Khalid who basically lives as Cocoa Cinnamon. It’s a pretty organic process for me and I really enjoy it. I’m looking forward to doing a few “extra practice” assignments throughout the semester just to get used to what full-stack is. 

Overall, thanks for the awesome class! Looking forward to keeping it going.
